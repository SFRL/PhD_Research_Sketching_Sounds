# Sketching sounds: using sound-shape associations to build a sketch-based sound exploration system 

This is the repository related to my PhD research at the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London.

So far I have completed one study on how people visually sketch sounds with a simple digital interface.

## Study 1 part 1

The study can be found [here](https://sfrl.github.io/PhD_Research_Sketching_Sounds/Stage_1/Study1_part1/Study_setup/)

The Jupyter notebook containing the data anaylsis can be found [here](study_analysis_concise.ipynb)

The sketches have been compiled into an interactive gallery that can be explored [here](https://sfrl.github.io/seeingsoundshearingshapes/SSHS_website/SSHS_gallery/)
