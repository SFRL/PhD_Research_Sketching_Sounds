An interactive online gallery of sound sketches collected from a study with 28 participants. 
The interactive gallery uses data collected from a study conducted at the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London.
We try to find out more about to crossmodal associations between musical timbre and sound and how people represent sounds with a drawing interface.
