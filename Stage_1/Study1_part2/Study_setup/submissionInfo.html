    <h2>Participant Information Sheet</h2>
    <b>Queen Mary Ethic of Research Committee Ref: </b>
    <p>
        Thank you for completing our mini-game. 
        We would now like to invite you to be part of this research project, if you would like to. 
        You should only agree to take part if you want to; it is entirely up to you. 
        If you choose not to take part, there won’t be any disadvantages for you and you will hear no more about it.

        This research project is concerned with finding out how people generally associate visual shapes with sounds. The sketches included in the mini-game 
        stem from a prior study where participants were asked to sketch their visual interpretation of the same sounds used in this game.
        By analysing your answers, we hope to gain deeper insight into which sounds can be communicated more easily through visual sketches and 
        which type of sketch approach is suited best for visualising sound. To do so, we will have to collect data from your interaction with the game 
        in a Firebase database. Submissions are completely anonymous, we will <b>not</b> collect any information that could enable us to identify you. <br><br>
        We designed this study as an interactive, fun game-experience rather than a "traditional" academic study. Research shows that a gamified 
        environment can lead to more intuitive, unbiased data, larger participant numbers and lower participant fatigue. Therefore, the academic purpose of this game
        is only highlighted at this stage. However, we will only collect data if you give your consent.      
    </p>
    <p>A list of all data that is collected:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Score: </b> Your final score.</li>
        <li><b>Sound order: </b>The order in which you heard the sounds during the game.</li>
        <li><b>Artist order: </b>An ordered list of the artists whose sketches you saw.</li>
        <li><b>Sketch choices: </b>An ordered list of the sketches that you selected in each round.</li>
        <li><b>System details: </b> We collect the name of your browser (e.g. Chrome) and your operating system (e.g. Windows) for troubleshooting and future improvements </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition, a cookie will be set if you choose to submit your data. The cookie contains a random, auto-generated user-ID and is used
    to identify multiple submissions by the same person. The cookie automatically expires 7 days after creation.</p>
