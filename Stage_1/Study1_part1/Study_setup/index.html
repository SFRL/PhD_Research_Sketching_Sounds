            We would like to invite you to be part of this research project, if you would like to. You should only agree to take part if you want to,
            it is entirely up to you. If you choose not to take part there won’t be any disadvantages for you and you will hear no more about it.
            Please read the following information carefully before you decide to take part; this will tell you why the research is being done and
            what you will be asked to do if you take part.
            If you decide to take part, on the next page you will be asked to confirm your consent.
            You are still free to withdraw at any time and without giving a reason by simply leaving the study and your data will not be collected. <br><br>

            This study aims to find out more about the associations humans make between sounds and shapes. You will be presented with 20 sounds
            and asked to spontaneously sketch them using the touchpad and a web interface. You will be presented with detailed instructions
            and a test run before the study starts. In addition, you will be asked a few questions about your persona, your musicality and your experience with
            this study. We hope that the results will improve our knowledge of music perception and can help to develop new music retrieval systems. <br><br>

            It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part please click “Next”. You will be asked to confirm your consent
            on the next page. <br><br>

                The black square under these instructions marks your drawing canvas. You can draw white lines on it by holding down

            </li>
            <li>
                After you click "Start" you will hear a sound. Your task is to draw whatever you think represents this sound best.
                The sound will loop automatically but you can pause it if you like.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you completed the drawing click "Next" and the next sound will start playing automatically. Your task is again to draw the sound.
                Repeat this until you are directed to the next page (there are 20 sounds in total). Please put on your headphones now.
